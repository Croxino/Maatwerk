        Welcome, adventurer!
        You are probably wondering where you are... well... uhh...
        You had a tiiiiiny accident in your world... so you died.
        .
        ..
        ...
        But don't worry! You have been reborn in the world of Gaia!

        It seems like something went wrong with the rebirth teleportation and it transfered you right 
        outside of the adventurer town.

        Well enough talking lets head north to our destination.
        Oh! before I forget heres a wooden sword there are monster outside of the town, but nothing you 
        can't handle adventurer!
